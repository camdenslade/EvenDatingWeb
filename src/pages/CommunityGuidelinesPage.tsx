const COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES = `EVEN DATING — COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
Last Updated: January 2026

These Community Guidelines exist to keep Even a safe, respectful, and authentic space for
everyone. All users must follow these rules. Violations may result in warnings, restrictions,
or permanent removal from the platform.

1. Be Respectful
Treat others with kindness and basic respect. You may not:
• Insult, demean, or harass others
• Engage in discriminatory or hateful behavior
• Use slurs, threats, or hostile language
• Intentionally provoke, manipulate, or antagonize users

2. Authenticity & Honesty
Users must be real people presenting themselves honestly. You may not:
• Impersonate anyone
• Use fake photos, stolen media, or AI-generated likenesses of real people
• Misrepresent your age, identity, relationship status, or intentions
• Create multiple or deceptive accounts

3. Safe Communication
Keep conversations appropriate and consensual. You may not:
• Send unsolicited sexual messages or explicit images
• Pressure or coerce others into sharing personal content
• Engage in harassment, stalking, or intimidation
• Attempt to move users to unsafe platforms for harmful purposes

4. Appropriate Content
Profiles and messages must remain safe for the community. You may not:
• Upload explicit or pornographic images
• Share violent, graphic, or disturbing content
• Promote self-harm, substance abuse, or dangerous activities
• Post private information of yourself or others

5. No Illegal or Harmful Activity
You may not use Even Dating for:
• Fraud, scams, or financial exploitation
• Selling products, services, or companionship
• Doxxing, hacking, or distributing malware
• Any activity prohibited by law in your region

6. In-Person Safety
If you choose to meet someone:
• Meet in public places
• Tell a friend where you're going
• Trust your instincts and leave if something feels off
Even Dating does not verify the criminal history or intentions of users—exercise caution.

7. Respect Boundaries & Consent
All interactions must be voluntary and mutual. You may not:
• Continue messaging someone who asks you to stop
• Pressure others for dates, photos, or meetings
• Attempt to bypass blocks or restrictions
• Disregard another user's stated preferences or attempt to evade blocks/filters

8. Underage Safety
Even Dating is strictly for adults 18+. You may not:
• Create an account if under 18
• Post photos of minors alone
• Attempt to contact, solicit, or involve minors in any way

9. Reporting Problems
You should report:
• Fake or suspicious accounts
• Harassment, threats, or abusive behavior
• Underage users
• Safety risks, scams, or violations of these Guidelines
Our team reviews reports and takes appropriate action.

10. Enforcement Actions
Even Dating may:
• Issue warnings or temporary restrictions
• Remove content or photos
• Limit your visibility in discovery
• Suspend or permanently ban your account
Repeated or severe violations result in immediate removal.

11. Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was a mistake, you may request a review. Decisions
made for user safety may not be reversible.

12. Evolving Guidelines
We may update these rules as the community grows. Staying on the platform means you
agree to follow the most current version of these Guidelines.

Help keep Even Dating safe. Treat others with respect. Report misconduct when you see it.
